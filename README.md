# Objective PHP / Starter Kit

## Project topic

Typical Objective PHP project arborescence, with minimal workflow and configuration implementation.

This is where to start your own Objective PHP project.

## How to make it work

A few simple steps are needed to get this application up and running:

```
git clone https://github.com/objective-php/starter-kit
cd showcase

# the next step assumes that composer is available in your PATH
composer install
php -S 0.0.0.0:8001 -t public 
```

You can then open http://localhost:8001 to access live demo of Objective PHP Framework. Note that the frmaework will show itself much more efficient when using a production grade web server (as Apache or Nginx), while the PHP built-in server will allow you to make the demo running within seconds.
